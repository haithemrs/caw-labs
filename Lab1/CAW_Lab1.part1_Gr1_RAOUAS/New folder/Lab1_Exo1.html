    <h2 id="point1">Brief History</h2>
    <p>
        The <strong>State of Palestine</strong> has a long and complex history rooted in ancient civilizations. 
        For centuries, it has been a crossroads of cultures and religions, playing a <em>vital role</em> in the 
        development of the Middle East.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the early 20th century, after the fall of the <b>Ottoman Empire</b>, the region came under British control 
        and later witnessed the establishment of Israel in 1948 a turning point that displaced hundreds of 
        thousands of Palestinians, leading to decades of <strong>conflict and occupation</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Despite ongoing challenges, the Palestinian people continue to <em>struggle for self-determination</em> 
        and independence. Today, the <strong>Palestinian Authority</strong> governs parts of the West Bank, while 
        Gaza remains under siege, enduring severe humanitarian crises.
